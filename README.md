# PPEPFinder
PPEPFinder (Plant Pathogen Effector Protein Finder), an integrated deep learning framework designed to predict effector proteins of fungi and oomycetes. PEPFinder consists of three individual predictive models: (i) a sequence-based Transformer model that utilizes rich semantic embeddings generated by a pre-trained PLM (i.e., ESM) as input; (ii) two structure-based Graph Attention Network (GAT) models that represent protein structures as residue contact graphs using the ESM-generated embeddings or the structure pre-trained model SaProt embeddings as node features. To integrate the predictive capabilities of the three individual models, PPEPFinder further employs a logistic regression model to aggregate their outputs into a final prediction score.
# Dataset
We provided effector protein datasets for two species, including fungi and oomycetes. data/ contains all the datasets.
The files data/fungi/fungi_postive469.fasta and data/fungi/fungi_negativedata1407.fasta contain the positive and negative samples used for training, respectively. The positive-to-negative sample ratio is approximately 1:3. The dataset is randomly divided into 80% for the training set and 20% for the independent test set. A 5-fold cross-validation is performed on the training set to evaluate model performance. 
The files data/fungi/fungi_additional_dataset.fasta contains 54 newly reported effector proteins were manually collected from publications published between January 1, 2023 and December 31, 2024.
