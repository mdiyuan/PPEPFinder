# PPEPFinder
Plant Pathogen Effector Protein Finder, an integrated deep learning framework designed to predict effector proteins of fungi and oomycetes. PEPFinder consists of three individual predictive models: (i) a sequence-based Transformer model that utilizes rich semantic embeddings generated by a pre-trained PLM (i.e., ESM) as input; (ii) two structure-based Graph Attention Network (GAT) models that represent protein structures as residue contact graphs using the ESM-generated embeddings or the structure pre-trained model SaProt embeddings as node features. To integrate the predictive capabilities of the three individual models, PPEPFinder further employs a logistic regression model to aggregate their outputs into a final prediction score.
